After Miguel and Bailey were gone and all their funerary arrangements were in order, Etan broke the news to Elmira that they couldn't live in this house anymore. They told her that they knew about the secret wedding, that they were happy Elmira had a new number one, but that they couldn't stay stuck in the past. They already had a new place lined up and everything, fortunately just a neighborhood away in the island on South Windenburg. 

Elmira was sad, of course, but after everything she understood why they needed to go and find something new for themself. The goodbye was hopeful, with lots of visits and babysitting shifts promised in the near future.

One last goodbye.

It was hard in such a suddenly empty house. But Ajei kept the days bright with her newfound ability to talk. The family's current butler, **Arzim Warcraft**, was her prime target for incoherent ramblings.

She really loved explaining the plotlines between her various toys and dolls.

Elmira wasn't quite sure if she wanted to find another job yet, and with tons of time now with just Ajei and Doba occupying it, she started to experiment with painting.

Everything was fine in the weeks since Etan left. They were too busy with moving to come and visit yet, but Elmira was happy painting, and Doba was starting to get into his gardening job again. Ajei was doing wonderful, and the days kept passing by.

But one day, with no warning (as these things rarely ever have), Elmira passed away.

A single cough and a loud thunk was all it took for everyone's lives to change forever.

Doba watched it happen, and before he could even check her pulse, the reaper came. He begged and pleaded, but...

She's gone.

Officially, her cause of death was a laughter and smoke induced asthma attack, Doba was telling her a funny story from work, and from hundreds of perfectly timed misfortunes happening at that exact moment, Elmira passed away without even a moment to parse what was happening. Doba has to believe it was a peaceful death.

To make matters even worse, that day was Ajei's birthday, she'd officially be aging up into a child. Doba and Elmira were chatting while the cake was in the oven. 

Fortunately, or unfortunately, Ajei was too young to really even comprehend what had happened. All she knew was that mommy was gone and that daddy would be extra busy for a while. But that was okay! She had lots of art supplies to occupy herself with in those weeks.

Lalalala ^.^

She got lots of visits from auncle Etan, too! They seemed really sad as well, probably because of her mom like her dad. But they came over to hang out lots, and Ajei loved to chat their ear off about anything and everything, showing them all the drawings of their dolls and toys.

Who knows if she'd have the same relationship with her auncle if Elmira never passed.
